<h2>Variable mapping - dealing with parametrized paths to libraries and resources</h2>

Whenever parametrized file path is used in resources or libraries paths (parameter value is assigned during test runtime), RED will not be able to evaluate parameter value by itself.<br>
<br><br><img src="variable_mapping/variable_mapping_5.png"> <br><br>
In this case Variables mappings can be used to statically assign value to variable for test editing time only. <br>
This will allow RED to resolve path to libraries and resources with parametrized paths. <br>
Open red.xml file by Eclipse Default Editor, in Variables mappings assign static value for variable in path:<br>

When successful, path will be recognized and validation will take place.

<b>Mind that Variable Mapping maps value to already existing variable</b>, if you wish to create variable and assign value outside of testcases (for instance as environmental global variables) create variable python file and import it into red.xml under Variable Files<br>
