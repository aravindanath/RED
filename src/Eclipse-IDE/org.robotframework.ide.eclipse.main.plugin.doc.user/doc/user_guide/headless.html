<h2>Headless - running validation in command line</h2>
RED can be run in headless mode to provide validation info of included projects.<br>
During validation, settings are read from red.xml of each of the projects thus preserving links to referenced libraries, variable mappings or include/exclude folders. Only opened projects are validated<br>
Output of headless run is report of validated projects and xml report in checkstyle format.<br>
<br>
Syntax:<br>
<i>eclipse -application org.robotframework.ide.eclipse.main.plugin.validation -data $WORKSPACE_PATH -nosplash -consoleLog --launcher.suppressErrors -import $PROJECT_PATHS -projects $PROJECT_NAMES -report $RAPORT_FILE </i>
<br><br>
