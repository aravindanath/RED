<h2>local Python variable files to deal with missing variables</h2>
In some test environments, Robot specific enviroments variables are used in test cases or injected as arguments to Robot test runner. <br>
RED is not aware of such usage thus those variables will be marked as unknown, error marker will be placed.<br>
In order to include variable name validation without changing test suites, user can create local Python file with list of variable names inside.<br>
Such file can be included in RED.xml under Variable files section thus making RED aware of previously unknown variables. <br>
Variables from such file will be visible as Global variables for all Robot files inside Project.<br>
Below is a sample body of such python variable file (examples can be also found in RobotFramework official manual and Python examples). <br>
<code><br>
#!python <br>
<br>
#Sample variables and values<br>
Scalar = 'value'<br>
UserList = ['value1','value2']<br>
UserDict ={'key1':'value1', 'key2':'value2'}<br>
</code>
