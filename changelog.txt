RED 0.6.1 - 2016/02/15

Bug

    Improve validation performance and progress reporting
    Missing automatic parameters in content assist
    Not supported characters in resource path
    Hyperlinks point to keyword base on appearance in file not base on Robot order
    Support files from remote locations
    Fix errors from validation project
    Resource is not parsed and colored correctly
    Adding error when Test case has no content (lines with comments)
    RSE - Project Validation does not work under RSE
    No error when keywords are duplicated but in other case

Enhancement

    Scroll bar in manpage from libspecs
    Adding python files to Content assist for Variables and section
    Add action to add libs from project explorer directly to red.xml by file and folder
    Proper value for robot env variables - ${EXECDIR}, ${OUTPUTDIR}
    Possible to run test(s) from Source Editor base on cursor location
    In case of duplicated keywords it will be nice to see declaration of all
    Variable mapping and paths - there should be no error/warning about absolute path
    Add support for keywords which in parameters get name of created by own variables
    Disable validation for commented part of line
    Mark deprecated or removed elements from section Settings to be exactly on same place like RF 3.0
    Support for importing variables, which exists as module
    Extend RED to recognize unknown settings in TestCases and Keywords

Feature

    Provide headless application which will validate projects
    Add wizard for creating new .py files
